ALTERNATIVE PLOTS:

Use DIFFERENCES between current plots. These differences are as follows:

FOR T=1950

DIFFERENCE1950-1: RED PLOT minus BLUE PLOT= SHIFT BETWEEN period before 1950 and period 1950-1969

{E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime before 1950 - E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime between 1950-1969}

DIFFERENCE1950-2: RED PLOT minus GREEN PLOT= SHIFT BETWEEN period before 1950 and period 1970-1989

{E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime before 1950 - E(t)  predicted LOCALLY by regime between 1970-1979}

 

FOR T=1970

DIFFERENCE1970-1: BLUE PLOT minus GREEN PLOT= SHIFT BETWEEN period 1950-1969 and 1970-1989

{E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime in 1950-1969 - E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime between 1970-1989}

DIFFERENCE1970-2: BLUE PLOT minus YELLOW PLOT= SHIFT BETWEEN period 1950-1969 and 1990+

{E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime in 1950-1969 - E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime between 1990+}

 

FOR T=1990

DIFFERENCE 3-INDICATOR 3: GREEN PLOT minus YELLOW PLOT= SHIFT BETWEEN period  1970-1989 and 1990+

{E(t) predicted LOCALLY by regime in 1970-1989 - E(t) and predicted LOCALLY by regime 1990+}
